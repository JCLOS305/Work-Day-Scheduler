# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day SchedulerCreated by Jeancarlos Mulet w/  ðŸ™Œ The University of Miami ðŸ™Œ

**Version 1.0.0** 

## Description 
For this challenge I was instructed to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Acceptance Criteria


- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist
